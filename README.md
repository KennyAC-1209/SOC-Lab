<h1>Security Operations Center Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Designed and deployed a cloud-based cybersecurity environment in Microsoft Azure to simulate enterprise-level
SOC operations. Configured and administered a FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall, including network
address translation, inbound/outbound traffic rules, and custom Intrusion Prevention System signatures
for RDP brute-force detection. Conducted threat simulations against Azure VMs to
evaluate firewall behavior, IPS alerts, and threat visibility. Integrated FortiGate logs with Azure Log Analytics
Workspace and Microsoft Sentinel to centralize security event monitoring and correlation. Created automated
incident response playbooks in Sentinel using Logic Apps to isolate and block malicious IP addresses. Performed
real-time incident triage and response, verifying alert accuracy, and mitigation workflows.
Demonstrated end-to-end SIEM and SOAR operations, reflecting practical skills in detection engineering, network
defense, and cloud security monitoring.
